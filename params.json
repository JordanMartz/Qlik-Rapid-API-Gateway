{"name":"Qlik-rapid-api-gateway","tagline":"Qlik Rapid Application Gateway","body":"![QRAG Logo](./images/QRAG.png)\r\n\r\nQlik Rapid Api Gateway(QRAG) is an open source Python implementation of Qlik SSE that simplifies data exchange between Qlik Application and API.\r\nThe intial use case was to allow Qlik to use AI/ML functions and interact with other executions engines. The system utilizes GRPC messaging from Qlik and currently in the inital release support REST, Websocket APIs.\r\n\r\nIntegration Use Cases are Following\r\n\r\n- Integration with Open API Calls\r\n- Interacting with Qlik Data on Third Party APIs\r\n- Training ML Models with Qlik Data\r\n- Scoring Qlik Data against ML Models\r\n- Integration to AWS Sagemaker\r\n- Integration to R\r\n- Integration to Python\r\n\r\nThe system is built around quickly **using qrag.ini and functions.json** to send request and **add results back into QIX engine**. It's goal is to help Qlik users integrate into API/Microservices Architecture.\r\n\r\n**Note: QRAG is in the ALPHA TESTING PHASE.** Core functionality is complete, please let Qlik Partner Engineering Team know if you run into any data, compatibility or install issues! Thank you for [reporting any BUGS in the issue tracking system here](https://github.com/qlikpe/qrag/issues), and I welcome your feedback and questions on usage/features.\r\n\r\n**Things that may happen if there is Qlik developer/Customer demand.**\r\n\r\n- Office Hours\r\n- Installation Videos\r\n- Use Case Videos\r\n- UI for Configuration rather than Configuration of Ini files\r\n\r\nFor Initial Release our target is support AWS Sagemaker Platform.\r\nPlease take a look at Readme inside Sagemaker folder\r\n\r\n## Licenses\r\n\r\nQRAG is published under MIT License Model which allows users to easily modify and share with your fellow Qlik Developers\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n_Breast Cancer Predictions Using Sage Maker_\r\n\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n- Integration with API Gateway\r\n- Integration with AWS Lambda\r\n- Integration with AWS Sagemaker Endpoint\r\n- Support for Websocket\r\n- Support for REST Endpoints\r\n\r\n# Limitation\r\n\r\n- Return value of QRAG Functions must be measures or dimensions wrapped\r\n- Parallel Execution is not supported\r\n- Expected Data Type is String\r\n- Input Value should be joined as comma seperated string in Qlik Script and sent into function\r\n- Currenlty only supports REST and WebSockets\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nQRAG currently supports Python 3.8+ and Qlik Server 13.72.5+. \r\nOfficial Docker Support is due soon.\r\nEach API Connector will need small different setting changes\r\n\r\n## Using Docker\r\n\r\n# Basic Usage\r\n\r\n1. Install QRAG on Qlik Server/ Remote Server\r\n2. Define functions in functions.json\r\n3. Define QRAG setting in QRAG.ini\r\n4. Restart Qlik Engine\r\n\r\n***For Specific Installation and Details Please see specific installations below***\r\n\r\n[AWS Sagemaker](./sagemaker/reademe.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Contribute\r\n\r\nThis is Qlik Partner Engineering Sponsored open-source project! I built it to be the most useful tool possible and take frustration out of writing SSEs. I also want to have all partner tools compatible with QRAG. If you have a toolset that you want to build compatibility with please let us know we can setup a folder and you can commit yoru code.\r\n\r\n### 1. Spread the word!\r\n\r\nA STAR here on GitHub, and a mention on Twitter or Instagram @qlik and blog post are the easiest contribution and can potentially help grow this project tremendously!\r\n\r\nMedium articles, YouTube video tutorials and other content take more time but will help all the more!\r\n\r\n### 2. Report bugs & issues\r\n\r\nI expect there to be many quirks once the project is used by more and more people with a variety of new (& \"unclean\") data. If you found a bug, please [open a new issue here](https://github.com/).\r\n\r\n### 3. Suggest and discuss usage/features\r\n\r\nTo make QRAG as useful as possible we need to hear what you would like it to do, or what it could do better! [Head over to Github Feature Request](https://github.com).\r\n\r\n### 4. Contribute to the development\r\n\r\nI definitely welcome the help I can get on this project, simply get in touch on the issue tracker.\r\n\r\n### 5. Bug Fixes and Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThere will be a monthly Pull Requests Merge done.  Please stay tuned.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
